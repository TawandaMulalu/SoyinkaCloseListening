The army had professed to turn Nigeria into a land where no one should feel a stranger in his own country. Sad to relate, the events of May, July and September 1966 and thereafter have since shattered those pious hopes and plunged Nigeria into uncertainty, drift and confusion. Wanton and premeditated acts of destruction against this region and its peoples have compelled them to reappraise their attitudes."

But it was not just the lear of oil wealth that drove the Igbo as a people to seek a separate existence led by Lieutenant Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, then military governor of the Eastern region. The prospect of war between the East and the Federation loomed larger every day, propelled by statements from Ojukwu which pointed the way to the breakup of Nigeria."

I met some and they let me go. Eventually there came this group of very young vigilantes with wooden guns and pointed the wooden guns at me and insisted on my identifying myself. So I identified myself and so, well, what do you do on this side? I said, well, I came to see you people and to see Emeka Ojukwu and to show...you know, searched me. Very, very excitable. For me, what was most amusing and at the same time rather pathetic and sad was the fact that they handled those wooden guns as if they were real guns, as if they believed in them. And it sort of was a kind of portent of what was to come that this was a people really unprepared for war, but with absolute faith."

If that is the price we have to pay for unity, then it's better for us to stand alone. So that decision to secede, as you put it, you don't just sit down. We must secede. We didn't do that. But we were aware that there must come a time if the other side continues along this line, then we have to face that. No matter how unpleasant or pleasant it appears to you, that is the point. We certainly were considering it from the minute the massacres took place. You see how we can live if we're going to be massacred. There are certain things perhaps you might like to remember too. After the first massacre, I was the one that got onto the air and said to the Igbos, please, this is an aberration, go back to the north. I was the one."
