    "description": "I’m interested in tracking the differences—between the written and the spoken word—in how Wole Soyinka narrates his memories of being imprisoned during the Biafran War in 1966. // What particular affordances does the aural experience of this narrative present to the listener that the written experience cannot? // What are the stakes of narration where ‘nation language’ can be heard explicitly versus implicitly, and how does this impact audience reception, or who Soyinka’s imagined audience might be? // What to make of Soyinka’s calm, considered retelling of his story (decades later) in the spoken versus written word: affective privacy or sublimated trauma or…? //",
